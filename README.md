Focus
=====
[Focus](https://3adnank.github.io/Focus/index.html) was inspired by similar websites, i just wanted to make a similar website for the open source comunity ðŸ˜€

How it works
============
It's all about mixing some soft and relaxing nature sounds to increase your focus and improve your productivity by clicking
on the icons and editing the volume until you find your best sounds combination.
